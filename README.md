Practicing my new knowledge of HTML by creating a simple recipe webiste. It is putting to use my knowledge of HTML elements and tags, HTML boilerplate, lists (ordered and unordered), links and images, as well as git updates and commit messages.

This project was completed according to instructions from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). This is my first project for this course.
