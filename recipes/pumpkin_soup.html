        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk or heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish</li>
    </uL>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pumpkin: </strong>Peel the pumpkin and remove the seeds. Cut the pumpkin into cubes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables: </strong>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Pumpkin: </strong>Add the cubed pumpkin to the pot and stir to combine with the onion and garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Spices: </strong>Sprinkle in the ground cumin, ground coriander, and ground nutmeg. Stir well to coat the pumpkin with the spices.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Broth: </strong>Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the pumpkin is tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend the Soup: </strong>Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, carefully transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream: </strong>Stir in the coconut milk or heavy cream. Heat the soup gently over low heat until warmed through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro. Serve hot with crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
