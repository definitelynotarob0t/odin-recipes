    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, then sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Mix until the dough starts to come together, then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.s</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Toppings:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>While the dough is rising, prepare your toppings. Slice the bell peppers, red onion, and mushrooms. Halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the black olives. Chop the fresh basil.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal portions for two pizzas. Roll out each portion to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Place the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel dusted with flour or cornmeal if using a pizza stone, or onto a greased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Arrange the sliced bell peppers, red onion, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and black olives over the cheese.</li>
            <li>Scatter the baby spinach leaves and chopped basil over the top.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the dried oregano and crushed red pepper flakes (if using) over the pizza. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice and serve hot.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
